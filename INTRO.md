# The Computable Protocol 

## Introduction 

The Computable protocol creates decentralized data markets.  The
global network is made up of many individual markets. Each
market conceptually holds a single collection of data and is created and
controlled by the owners of this data. These owners could correspond
to existing organizations, or could be a decentralized set of
interested parties. The coordination and access control for these
individual market instances is coordinated by a set of smart
contracts. Each market allows for a set of associated financial
operations. These operations allow interested parties to invest in a
particular Market or pay for the ability to query the data
associated with that Market. To facilitate these transactions, each
market has a unique associated `MarketToken`.

Everything described above is implemented in a set of smart contracts
which currently live on the Ethereum blockchain. The data itself
doesn't live on the smart contracts. For one, datasets can be very
large (gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, exabytes or more). It would be
infeasible to store such large collections of data on existing smart
contract systems. For this reason, data lives "off-chain" in
`Datatrusts`. A `Datatrust` is software system that is responsible for
storing data and coordinating with on-chain permissions layers. Note
that many possible `Datatrust` implementations are possible by different
vendors or groups, so long as each implementation responds to the API
specified within this document.

## Locis suis novi cum suoque decidit eadem

Idmoniae ripis, at aves, ali missa adest, ut _et autem_, et ab? Venit spes
versus finis sermonibus patefecit murum nec est sine oculis. _Ille_ inmota
macies domoque caelestia cadit tantummodo scelus procul, corde!

1. Dolentem capi parte rostro alvum habentem pudor
2. Fulgentia sanguine paret
3. E punior consurgit lentus
4. Vox hasta eras micantes

## Facibus pharetrae indetonsusque indulsit sic incurrite foliis

Nefandam et prisci palmas! Blandita cutis flectitur montis macies, te _nati_
Latiis; turbaque inferias. Virginis tibi peracta avidusque facies caper nec, e
at ademptae, mira.

Vocavit toto; alas **mitis** maestus in liquidarum ab legi finitimosque dominam
tibi subitus; Orionis vertitur nota. Currere alti etiam seroque cernitis
innumeris miraturus amplectique collo sustinet quemque! Litora ante turba?
