# The Computable Spec

This repo contains the documents that comprise the
Computable spec.

Every document in the top level of the repo is part of
the official spec, and is canon. 
### Viewing the spec

*Recommended:* You can view the spec [here](https://computablelabs.github.io/compspec).

You can also view it locally by using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

```
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> hugo serve
```

If you're just browsing on GitHub, start with [INTRO.md](INTRO.md). But really, we recommend using
the rendered output. It is much easier to read and use.

## Updates process for specs

Specs are updated as new Computable Improvement
Proposals (CIPs) are accepted and the Computable
protocol is amended. For more details, check out the
[CIP repo](https://github.com/computablelabs/CIPs)

## Questions on the spec?

Post a question on the
[forums](https://forum.computable.io/). Or raise an
issue here on Github.
