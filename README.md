# The Computable Book

This repo contains the documents that comprise the
Computable book.

Every document in the top level of the repo is part of
the official book, and is canon. 
### Viewing the spec

*Recommended:* You can view the book [here](https://computablelabs.github.io/compspec).

You can also view it locally by using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

```
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> hugo serve
```

If you're just browsing on GitHub, start with [INTRO.md](INTRO.md). But really, we recommend using
the rendered output. It is much easier to read and use.

## Updates process for specs

The book contents are updated as new Computable Improvement
Proposals (CIPs) are accepted and the Computable
protocol is amended. For more details, check out the
[CIP repo](https://github.com/computablelabs/CIPs)

## Questions on the book?

Post a question on the
[forums](https://forum.computable.io/). Or raise an
issue here on Github.
